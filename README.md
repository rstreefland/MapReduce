Coursework created for the Advanced Computing module at the University of Reading. The task was to write a simple multi-threaded map-reduce framework and use it to process and validate some data.

I'm willing to share my project report and documentation to interested parties on a case by case basis. Please email me at rhysaled.streefland@ntlworld.com if you'd like a copy.
